# StockManagement
I have put any objective that has not been completed in italics

You must devise a system to calculate utility bill for customers.
You can decide the features of your program but, obviously, the more complete (features) your system has then the more likely it is to attract good marks! Some of the core functions of the system are listed below.
1.	The employee name, contact number, department and relevant data will be stored as customer data.
2.	Items available at the stock and quantity must be stored.  Item availability must be checked via item name and *category.*
3.	Whenever an employee takes an item from the stock, the available quantity must be updated.
4.	The system must be able to keep the track of history of all employees taking items from the stock with date.
5.	*A simple report must be generated such as department and withdrawal.*
6.	*Nicely designed* (console based) bin card must be displayed with comprehensive information. In addition to this total withdraw for an employee and the whole department also can be viewed.
You must document your system requirements e.g. an overview & the system purpose.  Your program also should be accompanied by a pseudo code.
*Your system should be demonstrated by using an intuitive and clear interface*
